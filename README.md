Some images SWIR thermal emission detected by an iPhone camera are shown below.  To the eye, these objects look orange in color and are somewhat dim; in
the iPhone camera image, they are bright and look almost pink in color.

As Justin explains in the episode, the silicon-based iPhone camera detects into the SWIR, but has a filter that blocks
the relatively small amount of SWIR radiation normally emitted at ambient temperatures.  However, the blackbody emission from objects
as hot as a charcoal chimney or a propane heater (>500 degrees celcius) is strong enough in the SWIR to be detected by 
the iPhone camera even with filtration.
