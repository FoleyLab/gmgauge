### [Episode 8: Interview with Jeamme Chia about Maria Goeppert Mayer](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1442191/episodes/7573144)

[Jeamme Chia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeammechia/), who did original research on Maria Goeppert Mayer's time at Sarah Lawrence College, joins us to talk about our namesake at a particularly formative time in her career.   

You can read more about Jeamme's current work on environmental policy, with a particular focus on the relocation of Indonesia's capitol, [here!](https://tri.yale.edu/people/jeamme-chia)


### [Episode 7: 2020 Recap](https://open.spotify.com/show/7hh6eZ3TLxJFwuWnLAXM6L?si=qp-GQc4ZSXGgvbvyYtUi2w)

What better way to celebrate the end of 2020 than by talking about it for 80 minutes? We take a break from science talk and (mostly) leave aside the bad stuff from the year to focus on what music, TV, podcasts, and youtube channels kept us sane during lockdown. We also contemplate the future of in-person conferences and get excited for the Goeppert Mayer Gauge in 2021.

Some images SWIR thermal emission detected by an iPhone camera are shown below.  To the eye, these objects look orange in color and are somewhat dim; in
the iPhone camera image, they are bright and look almost pink in color.

As Justin explains in the episode, the silicon-based iPhone camera detects into the SWIR, but has a filter that blocks
the relatively small amount of SWIR radiation normally emitted at ambient temperatures.  However, the blackbody emission from objects
as hot as a charcoal chimney or a propane heater (>500 degrees celcius) is strong enough in the SWIR to be detected by 
the iPhone camera even with filtration.
